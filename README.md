# Accomplishments
In this project, we answered our research questions using Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib, and SciPy.
We created charts and graphs to visualize the data given to us in a lifestyle survey dataset that was supplied through the website, Kaggle.
The dataset can be seen in our 'resources' folder.
We then organized our visualizations into a powerpoint and presented to our colleagues.
